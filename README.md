# Pymazingl

Pymazingl is an experiment in connecting Python, C, and OpenGL (through C).

The goal is to have a C program that calls Python code to generate a maze, and then visualizes this maze using OpenGL.

Currently, the maze-generation code is mostly done (though the output format may have to be changed a bit to make it nicer to read for C, as it's a list of a list of objects).
